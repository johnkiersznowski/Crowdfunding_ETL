# Crowdfunding_ETL

In this ETL project, jupyter notebooks was used to extract, transform, and load provided crowdfunding data and contacts data.

From provided excel documents, data was read in jupyter notebooks to be converted to DataFrames and manipulated.
This data was cleaned, rearranged, renamed, changed data types, and more.
After necessary transformation data was exported into csv files to be loading to postgreSQL.
First the database tables were modeled using quickDBD GI.
This template was tweaked to successfully created tables with proper primary keys, foreign keys, as well as datatypes.
Following this data was imported into these tables and select statements confirmed the loading was completed successfully.
